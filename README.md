# Image Stitching using SIFT

This project implements image stitching using the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm. It takes multiple overlapping images as input and stitches them together to create a larger panoramic or composite image.

## Overview

Image stitching is a technique used to combine multiple images with overlapping fields of view to produce a wider panoramic image or a high-resolution composite. This project uses the SIFT algorithm to detect keypoints and match corresponding features between the images. These matches are then used to estimate the homography between the images, which allows them to be warped and blended seamlessly.

## Features

* **SIFT Feature Detection:** Detects SIFT keypoints in the input images.
* **Feature Matching:** Matches corresponding SIFT features between image pairs.
* **Homography Estimation:** Estimates the homography matrix between images using RANSAC.
* **Image Warping:** Warps the images based on the estimated homographies.
* **Image Blending:** Blends the warped images to create a seamless panorama.
* **[Other Features]:** List any other relevant features (e.g., automatic image ordering, different blending techniques, handling of different camera perspectives).

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The primary programming language.
* **OpenCV (cv2):** For image processing, feature detection (SIFT), feature matching, homography estimation, image warping, and blending.
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Bash

pip install numpy
[Other Libraries]: List any other Python libraries used.

Navigate to the Directory:

Bash

cd Image_stitching_using_SIFT
Install Dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt  # If you have a requirements.txt file
# OR install individually as shown above
Running the Code
Place Input Images: Put your overlapping images in the same directory as the Python script or specify the path to the images in the script.

Run the Script:

Bash

python image_stitching.py  # Replace image_stitching.py with the name of your script
(Explain any command-line arguments or configuration options.  For example, you might have an argument to specify the input image files or the blending method.)

Image Stitching Process
(Describe the image stitching process in detail, including:)

SIFT Feature Detection: Explain how SIFT keypoints are detected in each image.
Feature Matching: Describe the feature matching algorithm used (e.g., FLANN). How are the best matches selected?
Homography Estimation: Explain how RANSAC is used to estimate the homography matrix between image pairs. Why is RANSAC important?
Image Warping: Explain how images are warped based on the estimated homographies.
Image Blending: Describe the blending technique used (e.g., feathering, multi-band blending). Why is blending necessary?

Key improvements:

* **Clear Overview:** Explains the purpose of the project.
* **Features:** Highlights the key features.
* **Technologies Used:** Lists the technologies and includes installation instructions.
* **Detailed Getting Started:** Provides step-by-step instructions.
* **Image Stitching Process:** This is *absolutely essential*.  You *must* clearly describe the image stitching process.  Be very specific about each step (SIFT, matching, homography estimation, warping, blending).  This is the core of your project, and it needs to be clearly explained.
* **Contact Information:** Includes contact information.
* **License:** Reminds you to add a license.
